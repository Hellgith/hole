GROUP B – EXPERIMENT 1
TITLE:
Implement depth first search algorithm and Breadth First Search algorithm. Use an undirected graph and develop a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.

CODE:
from collections import deque
 
# New graph as adjacency list
graph = {
    '1': ['2', '3'],
    '2': ['1', '4'],
    '3': ['1', '5'],
    '4': ['2'],
    '5': ['3', '6', '7'],
    '6': ['5'],
    '7': ['5']
}
 
# DFS - Recursive using call stack
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node, end=' ')
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
 
# BFS - Iterative using queue
def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
 
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node, end=' ')
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
 
# Driver code	
print("DFS Traversal:")
dfs(graph, '1', set())
 
print("\nBFS Traversal:")
bfs(graph, '1') 

OUTPUT:
/home/student/PycharmProjects/PythonProject/.venv/bin/python /home/student/PycharmProjects/PythonProject/AI.py 
DFS Traversal:
1 2 4 3 5 6 7 
BFS Traversal:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
